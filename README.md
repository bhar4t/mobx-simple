# mobx-examples
A collection of simple mobx examples. All the examples below have been written in ES5 without JSX. No transpiling required. Please feel free to make any suggestions for improvement.

Baseline Includes: React, lodash, mobx, mobxReact, and mobxDevtools.

Baseline decorators Includes: React, mobx, mobxReact.

## MobX stand-alone examples
Please note that I have created a console.log override that prints the console.logs out to the results window on JSFiddle.
